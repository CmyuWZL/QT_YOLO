# YOLOv4-Qt-OpenCV-Detection 🚀🔍

A Python application that utilizes **YOLOv4** for object detection and face detection with the help of **Qt** for GUI and **OpenCV** for image processing 📚💻.

## Overview 📖
This project aims to demonstrate the real-time object and face detection capabilities using the powerful YOLOv4 algorithm. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Qt framework and leverages OpenCV for additional image processing tasks 🛠️🔧.

## Features 🌟
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv4 🚀
- Real-time face detection 🔍
- GUI for easy interaction 📱
- Customizable detection parameters ⚙️

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x
- Qt 5 or higher
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
- YOLOv4 pre-trained weights

## Installation 📦
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YOLOv4-Qt-OpenCV-Detection.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the YOLOv4 pre-trained weights from the official [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov4/) and place them in the `weights` directory.

## Usage 🎨
1. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. The GUI will open, allowing you to select an image or video stream for detection.
3. The detected objects and faces will be highlighted in real-time.
